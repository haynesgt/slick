# Use Cases

I want to be able to open the app and immediately resume working on a page if I had a document open,
or work on a new document otherwise.

I want to be able to just draw with no other elements visible.

I want to be able to access the options and controls of the app by tapping the device.

I want to be able to switch to a recent document in one click from the main controls page.

I want to be able to navigate all my documents in the controls page.

I want to be able to save to PDF

I want to be able to edit the file on one device and resume editing it on another

I want PDFs of all my files to be in Google Drive automatically


# Design Ideas

The drawing surface is central to the app and should always be at hand.
Other views should exist around the surface, and the drawing surface should always be a tap away.
